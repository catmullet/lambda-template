  > Use the kms naming convention
- Run in the terminal ```create.envfile ```
  > This will take the env.example.yml file and create a new one for you
- Run the project from the root.
  > You should see that it is running on the port specified in the environment file.
  > Once we have an environment running lets start building.
- Rename the project by running ```./rename-project {{Project Name}}```
  > This can only be run once so choose wisely.
